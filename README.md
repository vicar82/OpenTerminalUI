OpenTerminalUI is a self-hosted, full-stack financial terminal that combines real-time market data, institutional-grade charting, derivatives analytics, portfolio management, and quant research into a single platform. Built with a terminal-style shell interface inspired by Bloomberg and Refinitiv, it delivers professional-grade workflows to anyone with a browser.

**Multi-market coverage** across NSE, BSE, NYSE, NASDAQ, crypto, commodities, forex, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. **70+ technical indicators**, **multi-panel chart workstations**, **F&O option chains with live Greeks**, **backtesting with Model Lab**, **portfolio analytics with risk engine**, and an **extensible plugin system** &mdash; all running on your own hardware.

+---------------------------------------------------+
```

### Data Flow

Market data flows through a unified pipeline:

1. **Exchange ticks** arrive via WebSocket adapters (Kite, Finnhub)
2. **Quote Hub** fans out ticks to connected clients via `/api/ws/quotes`
3. **Bar Aggregator** constructs OHLCV candles at all supported intervals
4. **OHLCV Cache** persists bars in SQLite (L1) and Redis (L2)
5. **Unified Fetcher** serves chart requests with cache-first, provider-fallback semantics
6. **Chart Engine** renders via Lightweight Charts v5 with indicator overlays

### Provider Waterfall

```
Request → L1 Cache (SQLite) → L2 Cache (Redis) → Primary Provider → Fallback Provider → 503
             HIT → return         HIT → return       OK → cache+return    OK → cache+return
```

## System Requirements

| Disk | 2 GB | 10 GB+ (historical data cache) |
| Display | 1280 x 720 | 1920 x 1080+ |

### Software Dependencies

| Software | Version | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Docker | 20.10+ | Required for containerized deployment |
| Docker Compose | v2.0+ | Included with Docker Desktop |
| Python | 3.11+ | Local development only |
| Node.js | 22+ | Local frontend development only |
| Git | 2.30+ | For cloning the repository |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hitheshkaranth/OpenTerminalUI.git
cd OpenTerminalUI
cp .env.example .env      # add API keys if you have them
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` when the build completes.

**Docker Compose profiles:**

```bash
# Default: Backend + Frontend + Redis (SQLite)
docker compose up --build

# With PostgreSQL for production workloads
docker compose --profile postgres up --build
```

### Option 2: Local Development

**Backend:**

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

- Backend API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Frontend dev server: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

## Environment Variables

The platform runs without API keys using fallback providers. Add keys to unlock full data access:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `FMP_API_KEY` | Financial Modeling Prep &mdash; US equities, fundamentals, earnings |
| `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Finnhub &mdash; US real-time WebSocket ticks |
| `KITE_API_KEY` | Zerodha Kite &mdash; India NSE/BSE real-time + historical |
| `KITE_API_SECRET` | Zerodha Kite secret |
| `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Zerodha Kite session token |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key for authentication |
| `CACHE_SIGNING_KEY` | Cache integrity signing key |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection (default: SQLite) |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection for caching and pub/sub |
| `OPENTERMINALUI_CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins |
| `OPENTERMINALUI_PREFETCH_ENABLED` | Enable background data prefetch |
| `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` | LM Studio OpenAI-compatible endpoint (default `http://localhost:1234/v1`; use `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1` from Docker) |
| `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` | Gemma model id loaded in LM Studio (default `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b`) |
| `LM_STUDIO_ENABLED` | Toggle the LLM emotion analysis (default `true`; falls back to lexical sentiment when off) |

## AI News Sentiment with Gemma 4 (LM Studio)

OpenTerminalUI integrates a locally hosted **Google Gemma 4** model, served through
[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), to power the per-stock **AI Emotion Indicator**
on the News workspace. The model reads recent headlines for a ticker and returns a
structured judgement &mdash; sentiment, confidence, and a market emotion &mdash; which
the backend aggregates into a 0&ndash;100 fear/greed index, a dominant emotion, an
emotion mix, and per-article bullish/bearish signals. All inference runs on your own
machine; no news or prompt data leaves your hardware.

### How it works

```
News (DB / Yahoo / Google RSS)
        │
        ▼
backend/services/stock_emotion.py ──▶ backend/services/lm_studio_client.py
   (batch prompt + JSON schema)          (OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions)
        │                                          │
        │                                          ▼
        │                                   LM Studio  ·  Gemma 4
        ▼
GET /api/sentiment/emotion/{ticker}  ──▶  Emotion Indicator (News page)
```

- All articles for a ticker are analyzed in a **single batched request** (large local
  models are slow &mdash; per-article calls would pay the latency N times over).
- The request uses LM Studio **structured output** (`json_schema`) so the model is
  constrained to valid, parseable JSON.
- If LM Studio is disabled or unreachable, the feature **falls back** to the built-in
  lexical / FinBERT sentiment engine, so the endpoint always returns a result.

### Integration procedure

1. **Install LM Studio** &mdash; download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/) (macOS,
   Windows, Linux).
2. **Download a Gemma model** &mdash; in LM Studio's *Discover* tab, search for and
   download a **Gemma** model (e.g. `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b`, or a smaller Gemma
   variant for faster responses).
3. **Load the model and start the server** &mdash; load the model, open the
   *Developer / Local Server* tab, and click **Start Server**. It listens on
   `http://localhost:1234` and exposes the OpenAI-compatible API at `/v1`.
4. **Note the model id** &mdash; copy the exact model id shown by LM Studio
   (visible at `http://localhost:1234/v1/models`); you will set it as `LM_STUDIO_MODEL`.
5. **Configure OpenTerminalUI**:
   - **Local development** &mdash; add to `.env` (defaults already point at localhost):
     ```bash
     LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
     LM_STUDIO_MODEL=google/gemma-4-26b-a4b
     LM_STUDIO_ENABLED=true
     ```
   - **Docker** &mdash; the container must reach LM Studio on the *host*. `docker-compose.yml`
     already defaults `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1` and
     maps `host.docker.internal`. Override `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` via `.env` if your model id
     differs.
6. **Restart the backend** (or `docker compose up -d`) so the new settings load.
7. **Verify** &mdash; open the **News** workspace, select any ticker, and check the
   *Emotion Indicator* badge:
   - `Gemma · <model id>` &mdash; the model is live and analyzing.
   - `Lexical fallback` &mdash; LM Studio was unreachable; the built-in engine was used.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | LM Studio OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Use `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1` from Docker. |
| `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` | `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b` | Model id loaded in LM Studio. Must match exactly. |
| `LM_STUDIO_ENABLED` | `true` | Master toggle for LLM emotion analysis. |
| `LM_STUDIO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `240` | Per-request timeout for the model call. |

These can also be set under `app:` in `config/settings.yaml`.

> **Performance:** large models such as `gemma-4-26b-a4b` are slow on consumer
> hardware &mdash; the first analysis for a ticker can take a minute or more (results
> are then cached). For a snappier experience, load a smaller Gemma / instruct model
> in LM Studio and point `LM_STUDIO_MODEL` at it.

## Testing

### Backend

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m compileall backend
PYTHONPATH=. pytest backend/tests -q --cov=backend --cov-fail-under=45
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npx vitest run
```

### End-to-End

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

### Gate (all checks)

```bash
make gate
```
